      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro Experience:</strong> Walkthrough by a veteran with 5,000+ hours of gameplay.</li>
        <li><strong>Latest Version:</strong> Updated for the Full Release, covering all current bug fixes.</li>
        <li><strong>Guaranteed Success:</strong> Demonstrates the "Right-Hand Rule" to find the exit in under 3 minutes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Escape the Backrooms Level 0 Text Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>Based on the latest game version, here is the detailed text guide to escape the Lobby.</p>

      <h3>1. Strategy: The Right-Hand Rule</h3>
      <p>Level 0 is an endless maze of yellow wallpaper. To avoid getting lost, use the Right-Hand Rule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From the spawn point, stick to the right wall.</li>
        <li>Keep moving right and circling the immediate area.</li>
        <li>This is the most consistent method to find all objectives without a map.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <img src="/images/levels/level-01-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 0 - The Right-Hand Rule" />

      <h3>2. Finding the Ladder Pieces</h3>
      <p>Your main objective is to repair a broken ladder to reach the ventilation shaft. You need to collect 4 Ladder Fragments scattered on the floor near the spawn intersection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Piece 1:</strong> Located at the main intersection ahead of where you spawn.</li>
        <li><strong>Piece 2:</strong> Directly in front of the first piece.</li>
        <li><strong>Piece 3 & 4:</strong> Continue following the right wall near the intersection; they are usually behind the partition walls.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-01-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 0 - Finding the Ladder Pieces" />

      <h3>3. Retrieving the Key & Unlocking the Exit</h3>
      <p>Once you have all 4 pieces:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Return to the broken ladder.</li>
        <li>Interact to repair it and climb up.</li>
        <li>Grab the Escape Key lying in the vent.</li>
        <li>Drop down and continue hugging the right wall.</li>
        <li>Locate the wooden door and use the key to unlock it.</li>
      </ol>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-01-03.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 0 - Retrieving the Key & Unlocking the Exit" />

      <h3>4. How to Cross the Trap Room (The Pit)</h3>
      <p>The next room features a deep pit with a grid of beams. Do not run.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For Beginners:</strong> Lean against the left wall (Hold Q). Wait for your character to stop swaying, then walk across while hugging the wall.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplayer Rescue:</strong> If a teammate falls, stand at the top, aim down, and press D + Left Click to drop a Rope. They can press F to climb up.</li>
        <li><strong>Solo Rescue:</strong> If you fall alone, turn your back to the wall you fell from. Look for an arrow on the pillar and follow it to a secret door that leads back to the start.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-01-04.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 0 - How to Cross the Trap Room (The Pit)" />

      <img src="/images/levels/level-01-05.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 0 - Transition to Level 1" />

      <h3>5. Transition to Level 1</h3>
      <p>After the pit, you will enter a dark hallway leading to a staircase.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Look for a Flashlight on the floor near the stairs. You will need this for the next level.</li>
        <li>Enter the vent at the top of the stairs to proceed to Level 1: The Habitable Zone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips and Tricks for Escape the Backrooms Level 0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjust Gamma Settings:</strong> Before entering the dark areas (after the Lobby), go to settings and turn Gamma up to 60% or higher. This allows you to see without constant flashlight usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Infinite Stamina:</strong> In Level 0, you have unlimited stamina. Even if the Bacteria entity spawns (which happens at the 3-minute mark), it cannot outrun you. Just keep moving.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> The old "Q-spam" glitch to clip through walls and the "fly over the pit" bug have been patched in the full release. You must play the level legitimately now.</li>
        <li><strong>Mistake Forgiveness:</strong> If you accidentally enter a level you didn't mean to, the new update allows you to turn around, open the door, and return to the previous level.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>Level 1 takes place in a massive, dim parking garage structure. Follow these steps to escape safely.</p>

      <h3>1. The Elevator Code & Almond Water Trick</h3>
      <p>To enter Level 1, you need a 4-digit color code.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Code:</strong> The code is randomized (e.g., Red, Red, Red, Blue). Look at the sticky note inside the elevator or try common combinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Secret Trick:</strong> As the elevator doors are closing, sprint out back into the garage. The elevator will "leave" without you, but the game spawns a bottle of Almond Water on the table inside the elevator room. Grab it—you will need it for Sanity.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-02-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 1 - The Secret Trick" />

      <h3>2. Collecting the Keys (Parking Garage)</h3>
      <p>The map is shaped like a square within a square (Chinese character "回"). Your goal is to find 4 Keys to unlock the central door.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Locations:</strong> Keys are spawned randomly in lockers or on tables in the side rooms.</li>
        <li><strong>The Skin-Stealer:</strong> This entity wanders the garage. It has heavy footsteps and may disguise itself as a teammate.</li>
        <li><strong>Combat Strategy:</strong> Do not hide. The Skin-Stealer cannot open doors. Lure it into a room, run out, and close the door to trap it forever. You have infinite stamina, so you can always outrun it.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-02-03.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 1 - Collecting the Keys (Parking Garage)" />

      <h3>3. The Medic Room & Sanity</h3>
      <p>Keep an eye on the Brain Icon in your inventory. If it gets low, your vision blurs. Drink Almond Water or find Medicine in the lockers to restore it. Once you have all 4 keys, go to the central door and turn the lock quickly (all players must interact if playing co-op).</p>

      <h3>4. The Basement (The "X-Ray" Trick)</h3>
      <p>After the garage, you enter a pitch-black basement maze.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Go to Settings -> Graphics and set everything to "Lowest". This removes the darkness (giving you night vision) and allows you to see doors through walls (X-Ray vision).</li>
        <li><strong>Finding the Exit:</strong> Look for an elevator door. It is usually on the 2nd floor (Right side) or 3rd floor (Left side). With the "Lowest" graphics setting, you can see the door outline through the walls to confirm the correct path without checking every floor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Unlocking The Hub (Optional but Recommended)</h3>
      <p>Before leaving, you can unlock a shortcut to "The Hub".</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Password Puzzle:</strong> Find the door with the keypad. The computer screen shows 4 columns of text. You need to click the text in the first 3 columns so they match the text in the 4th column exactly.</li>
        <li><strong>Power On:</strong> Go to the back room and flip the switches until all lights turn green (spam-clicking the last switch usually works).</li>
        <li><strong>Run Program:</strong> Go back to the PC and run DOOR.EXE. This unlocks the permanent shortcut door.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-02-05.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 1 - Unlocking The Hub (Optional but Recommended)" />

      <h3>6. The Final Tunnel</h3>
      <p>The final area is a long concrete tunnel with holes on the sides.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Exit:</strong> Run past the entity (pull it to glitch it if needed). The exit is the 3rd hole on the Left. Look for the white light emitting from it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for The Habitable Zone</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low Graphics is OP:</strong> Seriously, turning your graphics to "Low" in the dark section is the biggest game-changer. It turns a scary maze into a cakewalk.</li>
        <li><strong>Skin-Stealers are Dumb:</strong> They are fast but cannot interact with mechanics. Use doors as weapons to neutralize them early.</li>
        <li><strong>Sanity Matters:</strong> This is the first level where Sanity drains. Loot every locker for Almond Water, even if you don't need it yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-op Door:</strong> The 4-key door requires coordination. If playing with friends, count down "3, 2, 1" and press E together.</li>

      <p>Welcome to the complete guide for Level 2: Pipe Dreams (also known as the Abandoned Public Area). This level is a long, linear tunnel gauntlet featuring deadly steam bursts and a terrifying chase sequence with a "Smiler."</p>

      <h2>Level 2 Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ypd5PZsXBs" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stamina Trick:</strong> How to use "Run-Jumping" to save stamina (before the chase).</li>
        <li><strong>Steam Hazard:</strong> Critical warnings about the deadly steam pipes.</li>
        <li><strong>Smiler Chase:</strong> A step-by-step guide to surviving the final chase sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Flashlight:</strong> Location of a free flashlight at the start of the level.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>Level 2 is much more linear than the previous levels, but it requires quick reflexes.</p>

      <h3>1. The Start & Hidden Flashlight</h3>
      <p>You spawn in a long concrete tunnel with pipes lining the walls.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direction:</strong> There is only one way forward (follow the "STATION" arrows). The path behind you is a dead end.</li>
        <li><strong>Free Flashlight:</strong> As you start running, look for a small grate or shelf on the right side early in the tunnel. There is often a Flashlight sitting there. Pick it up!</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-03-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 2 - The Start & Hidden Flashlight" />

      <h3>2. The Long Run (Stamina Management)</h3>
      <p>For the first half of the level, nothing chases you. However, you need to manage your stamina if you are sprinting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro Tip (Run-Jumping):</strong> While running (Shift), press Space to jump repeatedly. This "bunny hop" technique conserves stamina, allowing you to move faster for longer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The Steam Hazard</h3>
      <p>As you progress, you will encounter a very dark section with pipes hissing loudly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Steam bursts kill you instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Use your flashlight. Watch for the steam jets venting from the pipes. You can either crouch under them or sprint past them between bursts. Do not touch the white steam clouds.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-03-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 2 - The Steam Hazard" />

      <h3>4. The Smiler Chase (Infinite Stamina)</h3>
      <p>Once you pass the dark steam area, you will hear a screeching noise. A giant Smiler entity will spawn behind you and start chasing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>New Mechanic:</strong> During this chase, the game gives you Infinite Stamina. Do not worry about resting—just hold Shift and RUN.</li>
        <li><strong>No Run-Jumping Needed:</strong> Since you have infinite stamina now, just sprinting normally is safer and easier to control.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-03-03.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 2 - The Smiler Chase (Infinite Stamina)" />

      <h3>5. Finding the Exit</h3>
      <p>The chase is intense but straightforward. Keep running straight down the tunnel.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Escape:</strong> Look for a doorway/hole on the LEFT wall.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> As soon as you see the opening on the left with a gate, turn in and run through. The gate will slam shut behind you, locking the Smiler out.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. The "Hub" Confusion (Lore Note)</h3>
      <p>You might see signs for "Level 4" or "Level 5" on the right side during your run.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ignore them:</strong> In the current version of the game, these paths are blocked or lead to death. The only valid path is forward to Level 3 (The Electrical Station).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for Pipe Dreams</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brightness helps:</strong> If the steam section is too dark, remember the trick from Level 1: turn your Gamma settings up. It makes spotting the steam jets much easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't look back:</strong> During the Smiler chase, looking back slows you down and can cause you to crash into walls. Trust that it's behind you and focus on the path ahead.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen to Audio:</strong> The hissing sound of steam is your best warning indicator before you even see it.</li>

      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlcjsuhqqH8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Circuit Breaker Locations:</strong> How to find all 9 breakers to open the exit.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Glitch:</strong> How to phase through walls to flip switches without entering dangerous rooms.</li>

        <li><strong>Navigation Shortcut:</strong> A secret path to backtrack safely between areas.</li>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>Your goal in Level 3 is to find and flip 9 Circuit Breakers to power up the exit gate. The map is divided into 3 phases/areas.</p>

      <h3>1. The Circuit Breaker Panel</h3>
      <p>At the start, you will see a panel with 9 red lights.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Every time you flip a breaker in the maze, one light turns green.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress:</strong> Once all 9 lights are green, the final door opens.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-04-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 3 - The Circuit Breaker Panel" />

      <h3>2. Phase 1: The First 3 Breakers</h3>
      <p>Head into the first area. Check every room carefully.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wall Phasing Trick:</strong> Some breaker boxes are located on walls shared with the hallway. You don't always need to open the door! Try walking into the wall and pressing E blindly—you can often flip the switch through the brick wall, saving time and avoiding entities.</li>
        <li><strong>The Hound (Doggy Bro):</strong> You will encounter a dog-like entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Normal Difficulty:</strong> Shine your flashlight on it to blind it. It will whimper and run away. You can do this multiple times.</li>
        <li><strong>Nightmare Difficulty:</strong> WARNING: You can only blind the Hound ONCE. After that, it becomes immune to light. Do not waste your flash!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Phase 2: The Item & Keycard Puzzle</h3>
      <p>After lighting the first 3 lamps, a gate opens to the next area.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Looting:</strong> Check shelves for Almond Water and Flashlight Batteries. Sanity drains fast here.</li>
        <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Press 1, 2, or 3 to assign items to your hotbar. You must put items in slots to use them.</li>
        <li><strong>The Breaker Puzzle:</strong> You will find a breaker box with colored wires (Red, Blue, Yellow, etc.). You need to cut/connect wires based on a nearby clue or just trial and error until the light turns green.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Phase 3: The Hound Chase & Shortcut</h3>
      <p>The final area is the most dangerous.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The "Invisible" Hound:</strong> In the new update, the Hound does not despawn. It roams the halls.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Cues:</strong> Listen for growling or footsteps. If you hear it, turn off your flashlight and crouch, or get ready to blind it (if you haven't used your one charge).</li>
        <li><strong>The Shortcut:</strong> Once you clear the back rooms, look for a side door that loops back to the Phase 2 area. This is a safer route than walking all the way back through the main Dog-infested hallway.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. The Exit</h3>
      <p>Return to the main panel where you started.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Lights:</strong> Confirm all 9 lights are green.</li>
        <li><strong>Escape:</strong> The large metal gate next to the panel will now be open. Run through the tunnel to reach Level 4: The Abandoned Office.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for Level 3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gamma is your friend:</strong> This level is extremely dark. Turn your brightness/gamma up to spot Hounds early.</li>
        <li><strong>Save your Battery:</strong> Flashlight batteries are scarce. Turn off your light when you are in a safe room or running back to the start.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't fight the Hound unnecessarily:</strong> If you see the Hound far away, just back off. Only shine your light if it charges at you.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-op Strategy:</strong> Split up to find breakers faster, but stay in pairs to watch each other's backs against the Hound.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Level 4 Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5IO2o0TgH5k" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vending Machine Puzzle:</strong> How to solve the code without guessing.</li>
        <li><strong>Window Entities:</strong> Why you should never get close to the windows.</li>
        <li><strong>The Hub Trap:</strong> Warning about the fake exit and how to return if you get lost.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Stealth:</strong> How to bypass the security system and reset the alarm.</li>
        <li><strong>Crowbar Secret:</strong> Location of a hidden vent/Easter egg at the end.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>Level 4 requires observation. You need to count objects to unlock doors and use stealth to avoid security alarms.</p>

      <h3>1. The Windows (Trap Warning)</h3>
      <p>As you enter the office hallways, you will see windows with rain/darkness outside.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DANGER:</strong> Do not approach the windows. There are Window Entities hidden behind the glass. If you get too close, they will grab you and kill you instantly. Stay in the middle of the hallway.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-05-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 4 - The Windows (Trap Warning)" />

      <h3>2. The Vending Machine Puzzle</h3>
      <p>To progress, you will encounter locked doors controlled by Vending Machines with keypads.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Mechanic:</strong> Look around the immediate room. You need to count specific objects: Chairs (Stools), Tables, or Water Dispensers.</li>
        <li><strong>Solving the Code:</strong></li>
        <li>Check the icon on the vending machine (e.g., a picture of a Table).</li>
        <li>Count how many of that item are in the room.</li>
        <li>Press the corresponding number on the keypad.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Sometimes objects are hidden behind pillars. If you can't find the exact number, just brute-force it! Try the most likely numbers (usually between 3 and 8) until the door opens.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-05-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 4 - The Vending Machine Puzzle" />

      <h3>3. Navigation: The Right-Hand Rule</h3>
      <p>The office maze is repetitive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Just like previous levels, sticking to the Right-Hand Rule (hugging the right wall) is the most effective way to navigate through the random rooms without getting disoriented.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-05-03.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 4 - The Right-Hand Rule" />

      <h3>4. The Hub "Trap"</h3>
      <p>You may find a door labeled "The Hub".</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Do NOT enter The Hub unless you want to backtrack. It is not the exit for this level yet.</li>
        <li><strong>How to Escape:</strong> If you accidentally enter The Hub, look for a door marked with the number "4". This will take you back to the start of Level 4 so you can try again.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. The Security Cameras</h3>
      <p>The final section involves a long hallway monitored by security cameras.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Threat:</strong> If a camera spots you, it turns red, an alarm sounds, and the exit door locks.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Move carefully. Stick to the walls (blind spots).</li>
        <li><strong>Reset Button:</strong> If you trigger the alarm, don't panic. Run to the end of the hall or look for a room with a "Reset Camera" Button. Press it to turn the alarm off and unlock the door again.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <img src="/images/levels/level-05-04.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 4 - The Security Cameras" />

      <img src="/images/levels/level-05-05.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 4 - The Security Cameras" />

      <h3>6. The Exit & Crowbar Secret</h3>
      <p>After passing the cameras, you will find a room with an Exit Door and a Vent on the wall.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Exit:</strong> Go through the door to proceed to the next level (The Terror Hotel).</li>
        <li><strong>Easter Egg:</strong> If you still have the Crowbar (found in earlier levels or lockers), you can pry open the vent near the floor for a secret shortcut/Easter egg that loops you back to the start (optional).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for Level 4</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Almond Water:</strong> Loot the vending machines! After you input the code, the machine often dispenses Almond Water. Stock up here, as you will need Sanity for Level 5.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen:</strong> The ambient noise is low. Listen for the buzzing of cameras to know when you are approaching the security sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Rush:</strong> Unlike the Pipe Dreams level, you have time here. Count carefully and check corners for loot.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Welcome to the ultimate guide for Level 5: Terror Hotel. This level is a surreal, vintage hotel that tests your sanity and patience. It is divided into distinct stages, starting from a mysterious portrait hallway and ending in a creature-infested boiler room.</p>

      <h2>Level 5 Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ebQrXMMcb8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Age Puzzle:</strong> How to navigate the "Hall of Portraits" (Young to Old).</li>
        <li><strong>The Restart Glitch:</strong> A god-tier trick to skip the final door unlock animation.</li>
        <li><strong>Moth Jelly Farming:</strong> Detailed stats on this powerful item and where to find it.</li>
        <li><strong>Secret Wall:</strong> A hidden wall you can phase through for a shortcut.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stage 1: The Hall of Portraits (The Age Puzzle)</h2>
      <p>When you first enter Level 5, you are in a clean, carpeted hotel corridor filled with portraits on the walls.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Mechanic:</strong> You cannot just run randomly. The hotel layout loops if you go the wrong way.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> You must follow the path of "Aging". Look at the paintings next to the doors or on the walls. Follow them in this order:</li>
        <li>Little Girl (Childhood)</li>
        <li>Young Adult (Male/Female in their prime)</li>
        <li>Middle-aged (Maturing)</li>
        <li>Elderly (Old Age)</li>
        <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> Once you reach the final "Elderly" portrait, the door nearby will be unlocked, granting access to the main hotel area (The Lobby and Boiler Room).</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-06-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 5 - The Hall of Portraits (The Age Puzzle)" />

      <h2>Stage 2: The Moth Hunt (Main Objective)</h2>
      <p>The main area is darker and filled with buzzing sounds. Your objective is to collect 3 Keys to unlock the final elevator.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Task:</strong> There are no keys lying around. You must trade for them.</li>
        <li><strong>The Trader:</strong> Locate a service window (reception desk) with a buzzer. The entity inside demands Moth Jelly.</li>
        <li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> 1 Moth Jelly = 1 Key. You need to do this 3 times.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-06-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 5 - The Moth Hunt (Main Objective)" />

      <h3>How to Catch Death Moths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Find Supplies:</strong> Look for Insecticide Spray cans on tables or shelves.</li>
        <li><strong>Locate Moths:</strong> Search the hallways and rooms for Death Moths (Small Male Moths) flying near ceiling lights.</li>
        <li><strong>Spray Them:</strong> Use the spray on a moth. It will drop a purple item called Moth Jelly.</li>
        <li><strong>Respawn Logic:</strong> If you can't find moths, don't worry. The game randomly respawns them after you kill one. Just keep circling the area.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stage 3: The Secret Wall & Moth Jelly Stats</h2>
      <p>Level 5 has hidden secrets that can help you survive.</p>

      <h3>The "5th Brick" Secret (Wall Phase)</h3>
      <p>As shown in the video (around 01:37), there is a specific spot in the hotel hallway.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Near the trading window area.</li>
        <li><strong>The Secret:</strong> If you count to the 5th brick on a specific wall section, you can walk straight through it. This is a "phantom wall" that acts as a shortcut between areas, saving you time from walking the long way around.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Moth Jelly: Item Stats</h3>
      <p>Moth Jelly is not just a quest item; it is a consumable buff.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sanity Restore:</strong> Consuming it restores approximately 40% Sanity (Upper Limbs). It is almost as good as Almond Water (which restores 50%).</li>
        <li><strong>Speed Boost:</strong> It provides 11 seconds of Infinite Stamina and increased movement speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Farm extra jellies before you leave! They are invaluable for escaping entities in Level 6.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-06-04.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 5 - The "5th Brick" Secret (Wall Phase)" />

      <h2>Stage 4: The Escape (Glitch vs. Legit)</h2>
      <p>Once you have collected the keys, you need to leave.</p>

      <h3>Option A: The "Restart" Glitch (Speedrun Strat)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Works only on Easy/Normal modes (where the "Restart Level" button is active).</li>
        <li><strong>The Trick:</strong> After you trade for all 3 Keys, do NOT run to the final door. Instead, press Esc and click "Restart Level".</li>
        <li><strong>The Result:</strong> The game bugs out. When the level reloads, the final elevator door will be wide open. You can just walk in and finish the level instantly without doing the unlocking sequence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Option B: The Legit Way</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Hard/Nightmare modes.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Take the 3 keys to the large double doors/elevator at the end of the main hall.</li>
        <li><strong>Unlock:</strong> Use the keys to unlock the gate. The keys will be removed from your inventory automatically.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for Surviving Level 5</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Over-Trade:</strong> The trader only gives 3 keys. If you give him a 4th Jelly, he will take it but give you nothing back. Don't waste your precious jelly!</li>
        <li><strong>The Beast:</strong> There is lore about a "Beast of Level 5" (a large entity). While it mostly serves as background horror in the window, always stay alert.</li>
        <li><strong>Sanity Drain:</strong> The "Terror Hotel" effect drains sanity faster than Level 4. Keep your sanity high by eating jelly or drinking water, otherwise, the hallucinations will make navigation difficult.</li>

      <h2>Level 5.5 Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7eDAm964Cv4" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The "3 Password" Exploit:</strong> How to skip the entire level using 3 fixed codes.</li>
        <li><strong>Mailbox Puzzle:</strong> The legitimate way to find your target room.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>The "Speedrun" Trick (Skip the Puzzle)</h2>
      <p>The most important secret in Level 5.5 is that the door code is NOT random. It is always one of three preset combinations. You don't need to run around the map.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Try these codes in order on the locked door near the elevator:</strong></li>
        <li>05938 (Most common)</li>
        <li>17564</li>
        <li>89472</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> As soon as you step out of the elevator, turn around to the locked door (Room 235 or similar) and input these codes. One of them will work instantly, allowing you to finish the level in under 30 seconds.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-07-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 5.5 - The "Speedrun" Trick (Skip the Puzzle)" />

      <h2>The Legit Walkthrough (If you want to play)</h2>
      <p>If you want to experience the horror or if the codes get patched, here is the intended solution.</p>

      <h3>1. The Mailbox Clue</h3>
      <p>Upon exiting the elevator, look for a shelf of Mailboxes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Find the mailbox that is open or highlighted.</li>
        <li><strong>The Number:</strong> Note the number on that mailbox (e.g., Room 235). This is your destination.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Finding the Room & The Code</h3>
      <p>The map is a square loop. Follow the room numbers on the doors.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Navigate:</strong> Walk through the corridors until you find the room matching the mailbox number.</li>
        <li><strong>The Code:</strong> Enter the room and look up at the Ceiling. The 5-digit code will be written there in blood/ink (e.g., 05938).</li>
        <li><strong>Return:</strong> Run back to the starting elevator area, find the locked door, and input the code to exit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The Hound (Room 21 Warning)</h3>
      <p>There is a specific danger zone in this level: Room 21.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Spawn:</strong> A Hound (Doggy Bro) often spawns inside or near Room 21.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pre-emptive Strike:</strong> If you have a flashlight, approach Room 21 carefully. Shine the light on the Hound once to make it run away/despawn temporarily. This clears the path for later.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> If the Hound is roaming the halls, CROUCH. Walking upright makes noise that attracts it. Stay behind it and keep your distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiding:</strong> If it chases you, you can hide under beds or inside wardrobes in the guest rooms.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Don't Restart to Spawn:</strong> Unlike Level 5, using the "Restart Level" button here isn't a free win. The spawn point is safe, but the code usually changes or you just waste time. Stick to the 3 Fixed Codes method.</li>
        <li><strong>Map Layout:</strong> The rooms are numbered sequentially but loop around. If you see Room 8-12, keep going to find higher numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Infinite Sprint:</strong> If you consumed Moth Jelly in Level 5, you might still have a speed boost. Use it to rush to the designated room before the Hound starts patrolling.</li>

      <h2>Level 5 (Boiler Room) Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_q_HErkpw3M" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thermometer Guide:</strong> How to use the thermometer (or visual cues) to detect moths.</li>
        <li><strong>Moth Strategy:</strong> How to crouch under moths and use steam valves to repel them.</li>
        <li><strong>Fake Doors:</strong> Warning about the trap doors filled with moths.</li>
        <li><strong>The Real Exit:</strong> Location of the only safe exit door.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>The Boiler Room is dark and dangerous. You need to be stealthy and observant.</p>

      <h3>1. The Thermometer (Optional)</h3>
      <p>At the start, you may find a Thermometer on a table.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> It detects temperature changes. High temperature means a Death Moth is nearby (female moths are hot).</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You don't need the thermometer if you are observant. Look for heat waves (shimmering air) distortion on your screen. That is the visual cue for a moth.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-08-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 5 - The Thermometer (Optional)" />

      <h3>2. Dealing with Death Moths</h3>
      <p>You will encounter large Female Death Moths. Unlike the small male ones in the hotel, these are deadly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> You can crouch and walk underneath them safely as long as you don't touch them.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggro:</strong> Do NOT shine your flashlight on the big moths. They hate light and will attack you instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Repelling:</strong> If a moth is blocking your path, look for a red Steam Valve on a nearby pipe. Turn it to release a jet of steam, which will force the moth to retreat.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-08-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 5 - Dealing with Death Moths" />

      <h3>3. Navigation & Fake Doors</h3>
      <p>The maze is confusing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Trap:</strong> There are many doors in the maze. Do NOT open random doors. Most of them are traps filled with swarms of moths that will kill you.</li>
        <li><strong>The Path:</strong> Follow the main corridors. If you get lost, try to stick to a single wall (e.g., left wall) or follow the path shown in the video.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. The Exit</h3>
      <p>The exit is a specific door marked with a green "EXIT" sign.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> It is usually located at the end of a long, straight corridor after you pass a few moth encounters.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Open the door marked "EXIT" to leave the Boiler Room and proceed to Level 6: Lights Out.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-08-03.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 5 - The Exit" />

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for The Boiler Room</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Run:</strong> Running makes noise. Crouching is safer near moths.</li>
        <li><strong>Save Insecticide:</strong> If you still have insecticide from the hotel, save it. It's more effective on small moths, not the giant ones here (use steam for them).</li>
        <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Keep your gamma up to see the heat waves clearly in the dark.</li>

      <p>After escaping the Level 5 Boiler Room, you find yourself back in a familiar setting: the concrete tunnels of the Pipe Nightmare. This is a short but intense transition level that leads directly to Level Fun.</p>

      <h2>The Pipe Run Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkGEH8cdQZ4" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Run-Jumping Technique:</strong> A critical movement skill to conserve stamina before the chase begins.</li>
        <li><strong>The Smiler Returns:</strong> Surviving the second chase sequence with the "Smiling Eyes."</li>
        <li><strong>The Exit:</strong> Locating the green door that leads to the Partygoers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>This level is linear. You spawn in a corridor with arrows pointing to "FUN!".</p>

      <h3>1. Orientation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Behind You:</strong> The path leads back to Level 5 (Boiler Room).</li>
        <li><strong>Left Side:</strong> Leads back to Level 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Forward:</strong> Follow the arrow marked "FUN!". This is your destination (Level Fun / Xiao Le City).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Advanced Movement: Run-Jumping (Bunny Hopping)</h3>
      <p>Before the chase starts, you need to move fast without draining all your stamina. The video introduces a pro technique called Run-Jumping.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to do it:</strong> While holding Sprint (Shift), press Jump (Space) rhythmically.</li>
        <li><strong>The Logic:</strong> When you are in the air, your stamina does not drain (or regenerates slightly). By alternating running on the ground and jumping in the air, you can sprint for much longer distances than normal running.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Try this early in the tunnel before the monster appears.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The Smiler Chase (Part 2)</h3>
      <p>As you progress down the tunnel, the lights will flicker, and you will hear the familiar screech of a Smiler.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Mechanic:</strong> Just like in Level 2, once the chase begins, the game grants you Infinite Stamina.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> You don't need to Run-Jump anymore. Just hold Shift and run straight.</li>
        <li><strong>Map Update:</strong> In the latest version, this pipe section is shorter than before, so the chase is quick. Don't look back.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. The Exit to Level Fun</h3>
      <p>Keep running until you see a distinct colored light on the right side.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Door:</strong> Look for a doorway on the RIGHT wall emitting a Green/Multicolor Light.</li>
        <li><strong>The Room:</strong> Enter the room immediately to end the chase. You will see confetti on the floor and 3 Ladders.</li>
        <li><strong>Transition:</strong> Climb any of the ladders. It doesn't matter which one you choose; they all lead up to Level Fun.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-09-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: The Pipe Run - The Exit to Level Fun" />

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for The Pipe Run</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Panic:</strong> This is much shorter than Level 2. As long as you don't get stuck on geometry, you will outrun the Smiler easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Cues:</strong> Listen for the "rumbling" sound behind you. That signals the start of the chase.</li>
        <li><strong>Gamma:</strong> Keep your brightness high. The entrance to Level Fun is bright, but the tunnel itself is dark.</li>

      <p>Welcome to the complete guide for Level Fun (also known as the Party Rooms or Pleasure City). This level is a deceptively cheerful maze filled with balloons, confetti, and deadly Partygoers. Stealth is key, but glitches can make this level a cakewalk.</p>

      <h2>Level Fun Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckxN2YKqFuQ" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Balloon Glitch:</strong> A game-breaking trick to freeze Partygoers in place.</li>
        <li><strong>The Table Glitch:</strong> How to exploit AI pathfinding by hiding under tables.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth Guide:</strong> The "Legit" route for those who want a challenge.</li>
        <li><strong>The Exit:</strong> Finding the door to the Poolrooms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The "Glitch" Methods (Easy Wins)</h2>
      <p>Level Fun is notoriously difficult, but you can break the AI to survive easily.</p>

      <h3>1. The Balloon Glitch (Freeze Trick)</h3>
      <p>This is the most powerful exploit in the level.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to do it:</strong> When you see a group of floating red balloons, click on them.</li>
        <li><strong>The Effect:</strong> Clicking the balloons triggers a sound effect/animation that confuses the Partygoers. In many versions, this causes nearby Partygoers to freeze completely. They will stop patrolling and won't attack you, allowing you to walk right past them.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> The sound range is limited. It only freezes Partygoers close to the balloons.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-10-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: The Party Rooms - The Balloon Glitch (Freeze Trick)" />

      <h3>2. The Table Glitch (AI Exploit)</h3>
      <p>If a Partygoer spots you, don't panic.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Run to the nearest white table and crouch underneath it.</li>
        <li><strong>The Glitch:</strong> The Partygoer's AI often cannot reach under the table. It will stand there menacingly but won't be able to "catch" you.</li>
        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not let them see you go under. If they see you enter the hiding spot, they might still kill you. Break line of sight first, then hide.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-10-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: The Party Rooms - The Table Glitch (AI Exploit)" />

      <h2>The Legit Walkthrough (Stealth)</h2>
      <p>If you are playing a patched version or want to play normally, here is how to survive.</p>

      <h3>1. Movement: Crouch Only</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rule #1:</strong> Always crouch (Ctrl). Walking upright makes noise and makes you visible over the cubicle walls.</li>
        <li><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Stick to the walls. Partygoers usually patrol the center of the hallways.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. The "Attraction" Strat</h3>
      <p>You can manipulate Partygoers' movement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lure Them:</strong> If a Partygoer is blocking your path, stand up briefly or step out to let him see you for a split second, then quickly hide. He will walk towards your last known location.</li>
        <li><strong>Slip By:</strong> Once he moves out of position, crouch-walk behind him to pass.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The Final Room</h3>
      <p>The last room is filled with Partygoers and confetti.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Path:</strong> Hug the right wall. Wait for the patrolling Partygoers to turn their backs.</li>
        <li><strong>The Exit:</strong> Run (or crouch-walk fast) to the small door at the end of the colorful checkerboard room.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. The Exit to Level 37 (Poolrooms)</h3>
      <p>After escaping the Party Rooms, you will enter a narrow tunnel leading to a water slide.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Slide Down:</strong> Jump into one of the colorful slides.</li>
        <li><strong>Destination:</strong> You will splash down into Level 37: The Poolrooms (Subliminality).</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-10-03.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: The Party Rooms - The Exit to Level 37 (Poolrooms)" />

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for Level Fun</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patience:</strong> If playing legit, patience is everything. Watch their patrol patterns. They are slow but kill instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Turn up your gamma. It helps you see Partygoers in the darker corners of the maze.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Listen for the "birthday song" or heavy footsteps. If the music gets louder, a Partygoer is close.</li>

      <h2>Level 37 Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpiHcFB49Sk" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <h3>Video Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sanity Regeneration:</strong> Why this level is a safe haven for recovering your mental health.</li>
        <li><strong>The Water Trap:</strong> Warning about the deadly "Hydrolytic Bacteria" in specific pools.</li>

        <li><strong>The Hub Warning:</strong> How to avoid getting lost in the Hub and find the correct path.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>Level 37 is largely safe, but navigation can be confusing.</p>

      <h3>1. Spawn Points (Solo vs. Multiplayer)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solo/Host:</strong> You typically spawn near a water slide exit.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> In a 4-player game, teammates may spawn at different locations. Communicate and find each other first.</li>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Look for a specific "wavy" area or a large open pool room with pillars.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-11-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level 37 - The Poolrooms & Deep Water Traps" />

      <h3>2. The Hub Trap</h3>
      <p>You might encounter a door or passage leading to The Hub.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> If you enter The Hub by mistake, you must find the door labeled "Level 37" to return. Do not go into other level doors, or you might skip ahead unprepared or get stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> From the start, sticking to the Right-Hand Side is generally a good strategy to find the main path.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The "Bacteria" Pools (Death Trap)</h3>
      <p>While the water looks inviting, not all of it is safe.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hydrolytic Bacteria:</strong> Some dark or deep pools contain invisible bacteria that will kill you instantly if you step in.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Cue:</strong> Look for darker water or deep pits. Stay on the tiled walkways whenever possible. If you must cross water, ensure it is the shallow, clear blue type.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Sanity Regeneration (Safe Zone)</h3>
      <p>This is the unique feature of Level 37.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Standing in this level automatically regenerates your Sanity.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> If your brain icon is low from Level Fun, AFK here for a few minutes. Let your sanity fill up completely before moving on to the next dangerous level. You don't need to waste Almond Water here.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Finding the Exit</h3>
      <p>The exit is not a standard door.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Sign:</strong> Look for a glowing red "!" (Exclamation Mark) sign or a specific red-lit corridor.</li>
        <li><strong>The Path:</strong> Navigate through the tiled maze until you find a narrow hallway lit with red light. This leads to the transition point for the next level (Level Run for Your Life!).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for The Poolrooms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relax:</strong> This is one of the few levels with no chasing entities (unless you count the water bacteria). Take your time to explore and recover.</li>
        <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> Enjoy the aesthetics. This level is a fan favorite for its "liminal space" atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>No Sanity Drain:</strong> Unlike other levels where standing still hurts you, here it helps you. Use this to your advantage.</li>

      <h2>Level Overview: The Red Hospital Chase</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Level !</strong> (pronounced "Level Run") is a high-octane survival challenge. The environment is a long, infinite hospital corridor bathed in flashing red emergency lights and blaring alarms. Your only objective is to run. Behind you is a horde of entities (Partygoers) ready to kill you instantly if you slow down.
      </p>

      <h2>Walkthrough Video</h2>
      <div class="video-container">

      </div>

      <h2>Critical Multiplayer Mechanics</h2>
      <div class="alert-box danger">
        <strong>TEAM WIPE WARNING:</strong> Do not rush ahead blindly in multiplayer!
      </div>
      <p>
        As explained in the video, the chase trigger is scripted based on the player in the front.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Trigger Point:</strong> The chase begins when the first player runs past the <strong>Second Door</strong> (shortly after the initial trash can).</li>
        <li><strong>The Risk:</strong> If your teammates are still loading in or walking slowly behind the "Trash Can" line when the front player triggers the event, the entities will spawn <em>between</em> the players, instantly killing those in the back.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Wait for ALL teammates to group up near the first trash can before sprinting past the second door together.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-12-01.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level !" />

      <h2>Movement Tech: The "Jump-Crouch"</h2>
      <p>
        To survive the obstacles (hospital beds, chairs, stretchers) without losing momentum, you need to master the Jump-Crouch.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Move:</strong> Press Jump, then immediately press Crouch while in mid-air. This lifts your character's legs, allowing you to clear taller obstacles like stacked beds.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Tip (Keybinding):</strong> As suggested in the guide, many players find it hard to press <code>Ctrl</code> or <code>C</code> while jumping. Try binding <strong>Crouch to the Right Mouse Button</strong> in settings. This makes spamming jump-crouches much smoother.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-12-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: Level !" />

      <h2>Route Strategy: Left vs. Right</h2>
      <p>
        The corridor is filled with random debris, but there is a pattern observed in the walkthrough:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stick to the Left:</strong> In the section with the heavy debris fields, the <strong>Left Side</strong> often has clearer gaps and fewer "stuck spots" than the right.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid the Right:</strong> The right side tends to have obstacles that can trap you (clip you into geometry), leading to an instant death.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Exit</h2>
      <p>
        Keep running until you see a door at the end of the hallway that looks like a drop-off or a distinct exit door. Jump through it without hesitation to transport to the next level.
      </p>

        After surviving the intense chase in <a href="/levels/level-run-for-your-life-walkthrough">Level ! (Run For Your Life)</a>, you will find yourself in The End—a massive library filled with bookshelves, tables, and a dangerous entity known as The Librarian. The level has been visually overhauled with sharper textures and new environmental details, but the core objective remains the same: collect tapes and escape.

      <h2>Step-by-Step Text Guide</h2>
      <p>Follow this comprehensive guide to successfully complete The End and progress to <a href="/levels/level-94-motion-walkthrough">Level 94 (Motion)</a>.</p>

      <h3>1. Mechanic Change: The Tapes & Computer (Quality-of-Life Update)</h3>
      <p>
        A major improvement has been made to the tape collection system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Old Version:</strong> You had to interact with the computer terminal <em>before</em> collecting any tapes to activate the tracking system.</li>
        <li><strong>New Version:</strong> <strong>You do NOT need to touch the computer first.</strong> As soon as you pick up your first tape, the screen updates automatically, showing your progress in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>Collection Goal:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Solo/Duo Mode:</strong> Collect 24 tapes</li>
            <li><strong>3-4 Player Mode:</strong> Collect 48 tapes (double the requirement)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Start collecting tapes immediately upon entering. There is no need to waste time at the computer terminal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. The "Bugged" Entity: The Librarian Exploit</h3>
      <div class="alert-box success">
        <strong>CURRENT EXPLOIT (May Be Patched):</strong> The Librarian entity is currently experiencing significant AI bugs that can be exploited for an easier completion.
      </div>
      <p>
        The Librarian is the primary threat in this level, but due to recent updates, it exhibits exploitable behavior:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blind & Passive State:</strong> The entity appears to be in a "blind" state where it does not react immediately to player presence. Testing shows that <strong>direct contact does not result in instant death</strong> in this bugged state, though this may be patched in future updates.</li>
        <li><strong>The Table Glitch (Safe Zone Exploit):</strong> If you position yourself near or underneath specific tables in the library, the Librarian's AI pathfinding breaks. The entity will not pursue you, creating a permanent safe zone. This is the most reliable exploit for avoiding the entity entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire Alarm System:</strong> There are two fire alarms located on the left and right sides of the library. While intended to lure the Librarian away from your position, given the current buggy AI, they are less critical. However, they can still be useful for repositioning the entity if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> These exploits may be patched in future updates. Always be prepared to play legitimately if the bugs are fixed.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-13-02.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: The End - The Librarian Entity" />

      <h3>3. The Environmental Threat: The Blackout Timer</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the exploitable entity behavior, the environment itself poses a significant threat:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Blackout:</strong> Exactly <strong>one minute (60 seconds) after entering the level</strong>, all lights will cut out, plunging the library into complete darkness.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> After the blackout, you must navigate using only your flashlight, making tape collection much more difficult and dangerous.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Prioritize speed. Collect as many tapes as possible in the first minute while you still have full visibility. Use the table glitch to avoid the entity and focus on efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplayer Tip:</strong> Coordinate with teammates to cover different areas of the library simultaneously to maximize collection speed before the blackout.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/levels/level-13-03.webp" alt="Escape the Backrooms: The End - Library Layout" />

      <h3>4. Tape Collection Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        Tapes are scattered throughout the library on bookshelves, tables, and in various rooms. Here are some tips for efficient collection:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Systematic Approach:</strong> Work your way through the library methodically, checking each bookshelf and table.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the Table Glitch:</strong> If you encounter the Librarian, quickly move to a table and use the safe zone exploit to avoid it.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen for Audio Cues:</strong> The Librarian makes distinct sounds when nearby. Use audio to track its position and avoid it.</li>
        <li><strong>Check All Rooms:</strong> The updated version includes new small rooms. Make sure to explore thoroughly to find all tapes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. The Escape: Critical Warning</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have collected all required tapes (24 for solo/duo, 48 for 3-4 players), a specific sound will play, and the ladder will drop or become accessible. However, there is a critical change from previous versions:
      </p>
      <div class="alert-box warning">
        <strong>SURVIVAL WARNING:</strong> Unlike previous versions of the game, <strong>the Librarian does NOT disappear or despawn</strong> when you complete the tape collection objective. The entity remains active in the library and will continue to pursue you. Do not let your guard down while running to the ladder!
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Final Sprint:</strong> After collecting all tapes, immediately locate the ladder and make a beeline for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> Even if you used exploits earlier, the Librarian may still be a threat during your escape.</li>
        <li><strong>The Ladder:</strong> Climb the ladder to transition to <a href="/levels/level-94-motion-walkthrough">Level 94 (Motion)</a>, the next level in your journey.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips & Tricks for The End</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exploit While You Can:</strong> The table glitch and blind entity bug may be patched in future updates. Use them while they are available, but be prepared to adapt if they are fixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed is Key:</strong> The one-minute blackout timer is your biggest enemy. Collect tapes as quickly as possible in the first minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Flashlight Management:</strong> After the blackout, conserve your flashlight battery. Only use it when necessary to navigate.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplayer Coordination:</strong> In multiplayer, assign different areas to each player to maximize collection efficiency before the blackout.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Get Complacent:</strong> Even with exploits, always have an escape plan. The Librarian can still be dangerous if you make mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Previous Level Preparation:</strong> If you are struggling, make sure you have completed <a href="/levels/level-run-for-your-life-walkthrough">Level ! (Run For Your Life)</a> successfully, as The End is the next challenge in the progression.</li>
      </ul>
